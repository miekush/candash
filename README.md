# CANDash
Controller Area Network Dashboard

The CANDash project is an open source Controller Area Network Dashboard display designed around the ATMEGA32u4 microcontroller, commonly known from the Arduino Micro. Other than functioning as a display, the CANDash also offers datalogging, 3 GPIO and Analog input pins, as well as two high current, short circuit protected low side drivers. The goal of the CANDash project was to create an open source, Arduino compatible dashboard for tuners and hobbyists alike.
